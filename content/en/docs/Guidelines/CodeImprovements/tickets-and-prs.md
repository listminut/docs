If something is irrelevant, close or delete it.

If it something is old but might still be relevant, see if you can move it
toward completion (or deletion). Try this: "This issue is quite old. I'm going
to delete this early next week unless someone objects. "That okay with you
@whoever?"

If something is new and relevant, but not actionable, see if you can add or
track down the information required to make it actionable.

I recommend working from oldest to newest.
