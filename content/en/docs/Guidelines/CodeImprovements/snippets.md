Get snippets support configured in your editor. (If you've already done this,
then spend some time adding a new one or two. Maybe delete some old ones you
never use. Tend your snippet garden.)

I think it's worth being fairly intolerant of unnecessary typing. It's slow,
error-prone, and puts mileage on your hands.

Let's type less and get more done faster.

Here are some places to start. How to make snippets inâ€¦

- [Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/snippets/)
- [Xcode](https://nshipster.com/xcode-snippets/)
- [Vim(via UtilSnip)](https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)

If your development environment doesn't support snippets, you can use a third
party tool to bring snippets to all apps. On macOS,
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) are
great.
