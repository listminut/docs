  Find something you do at least a few times a week and see if you can make it
  more pleasant

Here are a few ideas:

- Create a `bin/deploy` script to handle any tasks that you always perform
  before/after deploys. (One post-deploy task I like to include: open
  production in my browser to make sure I didn't just hose it somehow.)
- Create an alias for shell commands that you type frequently (git commands are
  good candidates). Here are my [zsh
  aliases](https://github.com/r00k/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/aliases) for more
  inspiration.
- You know that thing you do all the time that makes you think "there has to be
  a better way"? Dig into that and see if you're right.
- Find a way to save yourself some keystrokes.

In general: find something you do at least a few times a week and see if you
can make it more pleasant. Think of it as sanding down the rough edges in your
development environment.

I think you'll find this one quite satisfying. When I automate an annoying
task, I get a little burst of dopamine each time I use my new, improved method
to accomplish it. One-time effort; continuous payoff.
