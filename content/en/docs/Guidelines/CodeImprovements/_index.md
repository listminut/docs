     A list of small improvements that can be done in addition to every PR you make

During your time at ListMinut, you should take the time to do each and every
one of these exercises at least once. After you've done it once, you'll start
noticing that every time you are working on a ticket, there's a little
something extra that could be done to improve our codebase.

Big refactorings rarely work out. Instead, it's better to add a tiny
improvement in everything you touch in the code base.
