  Do you recall thinking something like "I really should know more about X"?

Today's your chance to do something about it.

Please spend 20 minutes researching that thing.

Maybe it's a technology in your stack that you feel a little guilty for not
knowing.

Or maybe it's a new tool that seems exciting but you haven't had a chance to
look into.

Don't worry about a full exploration. Just chip away a little at your lack of
knowledge. One step at a time :)
